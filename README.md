# Transcriptomic analysis of ISRIB action on <i>Danio rerio<i> brain in TBI condition

## About

We analysed gene expression changes after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and subsequent exposure to ISRIB nootrope in the brain of <i>Danio rerio<i>. In general we had 4 groups: control (C), fishes with TBI (T), fishes with ISRIB injection (I) and fishes with TBI and ISRIB injection (TI). In order to determine the main molecular responses of the ISRIB action, RNA-seq was used, followed by differential expression genes identification and pathway analysis. The results of the DESeq2 analysis were divided into three main parts corresponding to the predictors of the regression model (2 factors and their interaction). Each of the three results was analysed independently. The first factor (T) describes the influence of TBI on transcriptomic brain changes, the second (I) - the effect of ISRIB injection, and their interaction determines the difference between T and I.
